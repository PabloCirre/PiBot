## 🛠️ Why PiBot?

1. **Autonomous Scaling:** Launch dozens of independent AI agents on a single host.
2. **Local Sovereignty:** Your data never leaves the host. All AI (Gemma/Moondream) runs 100% locally.
3. **Advanced Automation:** Integrated with tools for screen scraping, computer vision, and mouse/keyboard emulation.
4. **Resilient Architecture:** Integrated systemd watchdogs ensure your bots stay online. If one fails, just **Terminate (💀)** and hatch a new one.
